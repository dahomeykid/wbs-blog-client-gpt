## Use Toast Notifications for Errors

User-Friendly Error Messages: We now provide specific messages for different types of errors (e.g., network error, API errors).

Toast Notifications: Errors and successes are shown as pop-up notifications, improving UX.

Error Display in UI: Errors are displayed in a styled alert box for visibility.
